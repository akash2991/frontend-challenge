# User Behaviour Analysis

1. User session
    1. For how long user is staying on our website
2. navigation paths of Web users
    1. to determine if a news article had been read after the respondents first visited the homepage or whether they used a link to a specific news item referred by, e.g., a personal e-mail, newsletter, or post on social media like Facebook or Twitter
3. Screen Tracking
    1. whenever a user lands on a screen we want to track the screen name. This helps in getting the number of screen views, the user retention on the screen, analysing the user drop outs from the screens.
4. Scroll depth
    1. If an user is scrolling too much, then it'd mean that our recommendation engine is not displaying relevant information at the top
5. Click events at Filter buttons
    1. To determine that out of the various filters, which filters are being used the most.
    2. This will also help us in determining the most popular categories
    3. And, supposedly, if filters are used sparingly or scroll depth doesnâ€™t reduce even after applying filters, it will highlight the need to come up with new filter categories
6. Click event on search field
    1. It will help us inn categorizing a user between active and passive(as passive readers are more likely to scroll, and active users are more likely to search)
    2. It will also help us in comparing filter buttons with search field (i.e. which one is being used more to filter news articles)
    3. Popular search queries can be presented as filter buttons as well.
7. Click events at hide and like button
    1. To personalize news feed
8. Click events on news card
    1. Where on the card we are getting the most clicks
9. Click events at Read More
    1. This will help us in personalizing the news feed of an user as we'd know which type of news he'd want to read in detail
    2. It will also help us in segregating user between casual reader and habitual reader (as habitual readers will click on 'read more' more often)
10. User Device
    1. To determine the popular hardware (mobile or desktop), OS(windows, ios or android) and browsers (chrome, safari, firefox etc.) that are being used to access our website. It will help us in prioritizing our optimization effort.
11. A/B testing on image size
    1. To determine if image size has any correlation with the other events on the page like shareability, read more , like etc.
12. User location
    1. To determine Whether the user sees the news as concerning their immediate surroundings.
